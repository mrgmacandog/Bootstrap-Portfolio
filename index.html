                    <p class="my-bio">I was born in the Philippines and moved to Seattle at the age of five and have lived here ever since, with the exception of living in L.A. for a year. I graduated the University of Washington in 2018 with a B.A. in Geography, focusing on the Geogrpahic Information Systems (GIS) track. </p>
                    <p class="my-bio">In addition to being passionate about maps and spatial data and utilizing them to solve real world issues, I also enjoy music. I love listening to all kinds of music and I especially enjoy playing music.</p>
                    <p class="my-bio">I play the alto saxophone, guitar, piano, and clarinet. The instrument that I play most well is the alto saxophone but it’s not very convenient and I have to set it up every time I play it. However, my favorite instrument to play would be the guitar because it takes no time to set up and since it’s a common instrument I can play it wherever I see one.</p>
